  excerpt: "Toronto\u2019s active tick surveillance program monitors the number of\
    \ blacklegged ticks, their locations and the number of them that carry the bacteria\
    \ that causes Lyme disease. This information helps to determine the overall risk\
    \ of Lyme disease in Toronto."
  limitations: Toronto Public Health chooses dragging locations based on suitable
    blacklegged tick habitat or a previous confirmed finding of a blacklegged tick.
    Blacklegged ticks may still be present in very low numbers at a site where none
    were found by tick dragging efforts. Not all locations are dragged every spring
    or fall, depending on the previous season's results.
  notes: "Toronto\u2019s tick surveillance program monitors the number of blacklegged\
    \ ticks, their locations and the number of them that carry the bacteria that causes\
    \ Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi). This information helps to determine the\
    \ overall risk of Lyme disease in Toronto. Toronto has been engaged in active\
    \ tick surveillance since 2013.\r\nThe tick surveillance program consists of ticks\
    \ found by dragging.\r\n\r\nTick dragging is a process of collecting ticks in\
    \ the environment and is done in the spring and fall when adult ticks are active.\
    \ Dragging locations are selected based on suitable blacklegged tick habitat or\
    \ a previous confirmed finding of a blacklegged tick. Blacklegged ticks may still\
    \ be present in very low numbers at a site where none were found by tick dragging\
    \ efforts.  Ticks are found in wooded or bushy areas with lots of leaves on the\
    \ ground or where there are tall grasses. As tick populations are expanding, it\
    \ is possible that blacklegged ticks could be present outside the areas identified\
    \ by Toronto Public Health. In addition, ticks can travel or migrate on the bodies\
    \ of animals such as birds and therefore can be present in an area for a year\
    \ in very low numbers and then disappear. The ticks are sent to the National Microbiology\
    \ Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation of species and testing of adults and\
    \ nymphs for Borrelia burgdorferi.\r\n"
