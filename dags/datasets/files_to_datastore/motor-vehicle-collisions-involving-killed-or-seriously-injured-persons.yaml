  excerpt: "This dataset includes all traffic collisions events where a person was\
    \ either Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) from 2006 \u2013 2021."
  limitations: "This dataset includes all traffic collisions events where a person\
    \ was either Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) from 2006 \u2013 2021.  The location\
    \ of crime occurrences have been deliberately offset to the nearest road intersection\
    \ node to protect the privacy of parties involved in the occurrence. Due to the\
    \ offset of occurrence location, the numbers by Division and Neighbourhood may\
    \ not reflect the exact count of occurrences reported within these geographies.\
    \ Therefore, the Toronto Police Service does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness,\
    \ timeliness of the data and it should not be compared to any other source of\
    \ crime data."
