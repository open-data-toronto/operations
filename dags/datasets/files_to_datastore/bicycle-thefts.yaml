  excerpt: This dataset contains Bicycle Thefts occurrences.
  limitations: This dataset contains Bicycle Thefts occurrences from 2014-2020. The location of crime occurrences have been deliberately offset to the nearest road intersection node to protect the privacy of parties involved in the occurrence. Due to the offset of occurrence location, the numbers by Division and Neighbourhood may not reflect the exact count of occurrences reported within these geographies. Therefore, the Toronto Police Service does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness of the data and it should not be compared to any other source of crime data.
  notes: |
    This dataset contains Bicycle Thefts occurrences by reported date and details regarding the stolen item where available.
    
    This data includes all bicycle theft occurrences reported to the Toronto Police Service, including those where the location has not been able to be verified. As a result, coordinate fields may appear blank. Likewise, this includes occurrences where the coordinate location is outside the City of Toronto.
    
    Note: The City of Toronto Neighbourhoods identified in this dataset correspond with the 140 neighbourhoods.
