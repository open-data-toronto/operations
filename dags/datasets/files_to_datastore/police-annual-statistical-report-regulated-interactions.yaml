  notes: "The Toronto’s Police Service Annual Statistical Report (ASR) is a comprehensive overview of police related statistics including reported crimes, victims of crime, search of persons, firearms, traffic collisions, personnel, budget, communications, public complaints, regulated interactions and other administrative information.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated December 11th, 2018, Justice Michael Tulloch defined “regulated interaction” as; “Where police collect identifying information from an individual about the individual on or after January 1, 2017, and the Regulation applies to the interaction. Where an interaction qualifies as a regulated interaction, police officers are required to do a number of things, including provide a reason for the interaction and a receipt documenting the interaction”.\r\n\r\nThe data provided in this table describes situations around the data collected in the interaction."
