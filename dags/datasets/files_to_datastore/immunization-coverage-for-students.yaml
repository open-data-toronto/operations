  excerpt: "This data represents vaccine coverage estimates and philosophical/religious\
    \ immunization exemptions by school, for diseases designated under the Ontario's\
    \ Immunization of School Pupils Act (ISPA): measles, mumps and rubella (MMR),\
    \ and diphtheria, tetanus and polio (DTP).\r\n"
  limitations: null
  notes: "In Ontario, the ISPA requires children who attend elementary and secondary\
    \ school to be vaccinated or have a valid exemption provided to their local public\
    \ health unit. As a result, each year Toronto Public Health staff work with schools\
    \ located in the City of Toronto to assess student immunization records to ensure\
    \ that all students are a) up-to-date with their required immunization and/or\
    \ b) a valid exemption for philosophical or medical reasons is provided, in accordance\
    \ with the ISPA.  \r\n\r\nThis data represents Immunization Coverage Rates and\
    \ exemptions for School pupils (7-17 year olds) in Toronto for the 2017/2018 and\
    \ 2018/2019 school years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor more info, please [visit here.](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/research-reports/public-health-significant-reports/toronto-schools-immunization-coverage-rates/)\r\
