  excerpt: Site and Area Specific Policies have been completed to reflect the 2015
    Official Plan Consolidation.
  limitations: null
  notes: "Throughout the City are sites and areas that require policies that vary\
    \ from\r\none or more of the provisions of the Official Plan and may require a\
    \ further\r\nlayer of local policy direction for an area. In most cases, the site\
    \ and area\r\nspecific policies provide direction on land use.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\
    \ The Site Area and Specific Policies shapefile does contain polygons\r\nwhich\
    \ are intended to overlap as the policy areas are not mutually exclusive.\r\n\
    The drawing order of polygons is software-dependent and cannot be controlled\r\
    \nby City Planning when preparing the shapefile. It is suggested to change the\r\
    \nstyling of the polygons to be outlines only with no fill. This will allow\r\n\
    users to view the overlapping polygons, as they will not completely cover one\r\
    \nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
