  excerpt: This dataset report information each year about the use and release of
    25 'priority substances' as contaminants in Toronto's environment and of concern
    for health.
  limitations: null
  notes: "Municipal Code Chapter 423, Environmental Reporting and Disclosure By-law,\r\
    \nrequires that certain facilities that exceed the specified thresholds, report\r\
    \ninformation each year about thel use and release of 25 \"priority substances\"\
    \r\n(as identified in the by-law\r\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_423.pdf).\
    \ These priority\r\nsubstances are found as contaminants in Toronto's environment\
    \ (mostly air) and\r\nare of concern for health.\r\n\r\nThe by-law came into effect\
    \ on January 1, 2010 and the first deadline for\r\nreporting of 2010 data was\
    \ June 30, 2011.\r\n\r\nThis ChemTrac data set contains chemical tracking information\
    \ submitted\r\ndirectly online by staff from each facility and includes the facility\
    \ type,\r\naddress, number of employees, contact information, use and release\
    \ of priority\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nSome companies that are below the thresholds\
    \ volunteered the chemical use\r\ninformation, even though they are not legally\
    \ obligated to disclose.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of disclosing the data is to inform\
    \ the public of these facilities\r\nand encourage businesses and the public to\
    \ pursue environmental improvements\r\nto reduce the use and release of these\
    \ 25 \"priority substances\".  The first\r\ndataset to be disclosed through Open\
    \ Data will cover the year 2010.\r\n\r\n"
