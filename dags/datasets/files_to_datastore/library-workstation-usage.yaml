  excerpt: This dataset shows the annual computer workstation sessions at Toronto Public Library branches.
  limitations:   
  notes: |
    This dataset shows the annual computer workstation sessions at Toronto Public Library branches. This covers public workstations that can be booked in advance and “drop-in” computers. This data excludes staff computers, library catalogue terminals, and wireless internet usage. Only computer sessions that have a duration greater than 15 seconds are included in the totals. 
    
    NOTE: A different reporting method was used for 2012 to 2017. The totals for these years are estimates based on manual counts of workstation activity executed on a quarterly basis.
