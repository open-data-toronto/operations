    The Toronto’s Police Service Annual Statistical Report (ASR) is a comprehensive overview of police related statistics including reported crimes, victims of crime, search of persons, firearms, traffic collisions, personnel, budget, communications, public complaints, regulated interactions and other administrative information. 

    This specific dataset includes all identified victims of crimes against the person, including, but not limited to, those that may have been deemed unfounded after investigation, those that may have occurred outside the City of Toronto limits, or have no verified location. 

    In accordance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Toronto Police Service has taken the necessary measures to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the reported occurrences. No personal information related to any of the parties involved in the occurrence will be released as open data.

    This data is related to table (ASR-VC-TBL-001) in [The Annual Statistical Report](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/annualstatisticalreport).
