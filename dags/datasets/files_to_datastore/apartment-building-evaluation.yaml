  notes: | 
    RentSafeTO: Apartment Building Standards is a bylaw enforcement program established in 2017 to ensure that owners and operators of apartment buildings with three or more storeys or 10 or more units comply with building maintenance standards. Learn more about [RentSafeTO](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/housing-shelter/rental-housing-tenant-information/rental-housing-standards/apartment-building-standards/rentsafeto-for-tenants/).

    This dataset contains building evaluation scores for buildings registered with RentSafeTO. Buildings must undergo evaluation at least once every two years. During evaluations, Bylaw Enforcement Officers inspect common areas, mechanical and security systems, parking and exterior grounds. Each item is inspected and assigned a score from one to three with one being the lowest and three being the highest. At times, an item may be assigned a score of 0 if it cannot be evaluated due to an obstruction or refusal to inspect. Additionally, if an item is not applicable to the building at the time of evaluation, the score will show as blank in the dataset.
