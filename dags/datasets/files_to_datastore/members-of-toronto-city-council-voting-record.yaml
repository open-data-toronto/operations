  excerpt: Access Voting-Record Reporting data for Members of Toronto City Council.
  limitations: null
  notes: |
    This dataset includes the following information about Member of Toronto City Council Voting Record. For official definitions and procedure by-law information, refer to the [City of Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 27, Council Procedures](http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_027.pdf) 
    
    **Description of the data**
    
    - The vote record data for a meeting becomes available **when the minutes for a meeting have been published**. For agendas with a large number of items, there can and will be a delay of several days after a meeting before this customized data becomes available.
    
    - Since 2010, recorded votes have been made available in this downloadable format (not just in the published minutes). _You may also find downloadable records prior 2010 that are the result of on-going data-conversion work for last-term meetings._
    
    - Votes generated in the report are recorded votes only. Under Article IX of the Council Procedures by-law, the City Clerk may be asked to record a vote for specific types of motions that are made by members during a meeting. When requested, votes are recorded as \"Yes\", \"No\" or \"Absent\". 
    
    - Vote results for motions can either be \"Carried\" or \"Lost\" depending on the majority or two-thirds requirements for a motion. _\"Absent\" can also indicate that a member chose not to participate in a vote because they declared an interest under the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act._
