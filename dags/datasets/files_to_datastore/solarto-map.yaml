  excerpt: The City of Toronto’s SolarTO Map was created through a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The Map calculates the solar potential of rooftops in Toronto.
  limitations: Solar potential is based on the entire “parcel” and not the address of the building. For properties with multiple addresses in a parcel (such as semi-detached houses, row houses, multi-unit buildings, commercial centers, etc.), the Map will aggregate the solar potential of all buildings in the parcel and the result will be inaccurate. Dataset works best if you open it with GIS software.

    The City of Toronto’s SolarTO Map was created through a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The software takes into account geographical latitude, as well as the sun’s daily position throughout the year. When users input their address, the Map generates an estimate of solar photovoltaic (PV) system size that can fit on the roof, its cost, savings and payback period in addition to greenhouse gas emission reduction calculations.
