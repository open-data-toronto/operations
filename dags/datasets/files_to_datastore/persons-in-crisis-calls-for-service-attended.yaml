  excerpt: This dataset includes all calls for service attended by the Toronto Police
    Service for persons in crisis.
  limitations: |
    The location of calls for service have been deliberately offset to
    the nearest road intersection node to protect the privacy of parties involved
    in the occurrence. Due to the offset of occurrence location, the numbers by Division
    and Neighbourhood may not reflect the exact count of occurrences reported within
    these geographies. The Toronto Police Service does not guarantee the accuracy,
    completeness, timeliness of the data and it should not be compared to any other
    source of crime data.

    Note: Fields have been included for both the old 140 City of Toronto Neighbourhoods structure as well as the new 158 City of Toronto Neighbourhoods structure
  notes: 'This dataset includes all Persons in Crisis (PIC) calls for service attended
    (CFSA) which includes the following Event Types: Attempt Suicide, Person in Crisis,
    Elopee, Jumper, Overdose and Threaten Suicide. This dataset includes only events
    that were attended by an officer of the Toronto Police Service (TPS), but excludes
    events attended by TPS members in Parking, Marine, Court or Primary Report Intake
    Management and Entry (PRIME). This dataset is queried based on reported date.'
