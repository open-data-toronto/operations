  excerpt: 'This dataset provides year-to-date availability metrics on current and
    past fleet assets owned and managed by the Fleet Services Division. '
  limitations: As the dataset only captures year-to-date availability of each asset,
    comparisons between multiple years and months cannot be made using this dataset.
    If a specific unit/asset does not have an entry for its YTD availability, this
    means the unit was not in use during the timeframe. This dataset only includes
    currently active Fleet asset's that are maintained by Fleet Services.
  notes: The Fleet Services Division (FSD) procures and maintains over 5,000 City
    vehicles and equipment used to deliver critical services. Fleet availability is
    a key performance metric that measures the percentage of time fleet assets are
    available for use.

    This dataset provides year-to-date availability metrics on current fleet assets owned and managed by FSD. The dataset also provides additional information, including the vehicle type, class, make, and model.
