  excerpt: This dataset includes the active and planned locations of the City of Toronto's
    Automated Speed Enforcement systems by latitude and longitude.
  limitations: null
  notes: "Automated Speed Enforcement (ASE) is an automated system that uses a camera\
    \ and a speed measurement\r\ndevice to detect and capture images of vehicles travelling\
    \ in excess of the posted speed limit. It is designed to\r\nwork in tandem with\
    \ other methods and strategies, including engineering measures, education initiatives\
    \ and\r\ntraditional police enforcement. ASE is focused on altering driver behaviour\
    \ to decrease speeding and increase\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThis dataset includes the\
    \ active and planned locations of City of Toronto's Automated Speed Enforcement\r\
    \nsystems by latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nFor a list of historical locations,\
    \ please visit the Automated Speed Enforcement website or contact us at the\r\n\
    email listed."
