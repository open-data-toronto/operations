  notes: The Development Pipeline examines how and where the city has grown over the past five years and provides insight on how it will continue to develop in the near future. The Development Pipeline enables City Planning to track urban growth, monitor development trends, and measure progress towards municipal and provincial housing targets. The Development Pipeline bulletin is published annually and the dashboard is updated quarterly. A subset of the Development Pipeline data is used to create this dashboard.
