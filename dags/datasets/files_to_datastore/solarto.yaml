  excerpt: The City of Toronto’s SolarTO Map was created through a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The Map calculates the solar potential of rooftops in Toronto.
  limitations: Solar potential is based on the entire “parcel” and not the address of the building. For properties with multiple addresses in a parcel (such as semi-detached houses, row houses, multi-unit buildings, commercial centers, etc.), the Map will aggregate the solar potential of all buildings in the parcel and the result will be inaccurate. Dataset works best if you open it with GIS software.

    The City of Toronto’s SolarTO Map was created through a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The software takes into account geographical latitude, as well as the sun’s daily position throughout the year. When users input their address, the Map generates an estimate of solar photovoltaic (PV) system size that can fit on the roof, its cost, savings and payback period in addition to greenhouse gas emission reduction calculations.

            notes: "Estimated annual electricity production of the proposed rooftop solar system measured in kWh. To estimate Annual Electricity Generation the following assumptions are used: 15% panel efficiency and 86% performance ratio. These values indicate that the solar panels are capable of converting 15% of incoming solar radiation into electricity, and 86% of that electricity is maintained, while 14% is lost due to soiling, inverter inefficiency, wiring, etc."

            notes: "The size of the solar photovoltaic (PV) system that can fit on the rooftop, measured in kilowatts (kW). It is assumed that 1 kW of solar will generate 1,150 kWh/year, based on average solar radiation in Toronto. The System Size is calculated by dividing the Annual Electricity Generation (kwh) by 1,150 kWh."

            notes: "Estimated electricity bill savings over the first year of operation of the solar PV system in dollars. Calculated by multiplying the average utility rate (assumed to be $0.156/kWh) with the Annual Electricity Generation (kWh). Solar PV projects connected to the grid participate in the Net Metering program. When solar panels produce more electricity than consumed onsite, the Net Metering program allows users to feed the excess energy to the grid in exchange for bill credits. These credits can be used to offset the cost of electricity used from the grid. For example, Toronto hydro (time of use) rates average about $0.156/kWh, so you save this much with each kWh your solar panels generate."

            notes: "Estimated total electricity bill savings over the first 25 years of operation of the solar PV system in dollars. It is assumed that savings will grow by 4.5%/year - assuming that the price of electricity will escalate by 5 per cent every year and solar panel performance will degrade by 0.5 per cent per year."

            notes: "The payback period refers to the number of years it will take to recover the cost of the solar PV system through the savings generated by the solar PV system. The payback period is based on annual electricity bill savings minus the upfront cost of the solar system."
