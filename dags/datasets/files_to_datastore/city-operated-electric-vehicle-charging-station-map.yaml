  excerpt: The map shows an expanding network of publicly accessible electric vehicle
    (EV) charging stations operated by the City of Toronto.
  limitations: The map includes City-provided charging stations but is not a map of
    all public charging stations in Toronto.
  notes: "The map shows an expanding network of publicly accessible electric vehicle\
    \ (EV) charging stations operated by the City of Toronto. The City provides public\
    \ EV charging stations at both on-street and off-street parking facilities, which\
    \ are managed by Toronto Parking Authority (TPA), an agency of the City of Toronto.\
    \ Moving from fossil fuel-powered vehicles to EVs is a key action in reaching\
    \ the City\u2019s goal of achieving net zero GHG emissions by 2040. For more information,\
    \ visit [TransformTO Net Zero Strategy](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/environmentally-friendly-city-initiatives/transformto)."
