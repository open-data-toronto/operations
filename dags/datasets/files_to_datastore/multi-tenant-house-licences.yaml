  excerpt: This dataset contains all active and inactive multi-tenant (rooming) house
    licences.
  limitations: null
  notes: |
    All operators of multi-tenant houses across the City of Toronto are required
    to obtain a licence to operate. The following dataset includes all active and
    inactive licences issued by Municipal Licensing & Standards.

    This dataset shows each licence broken down by status. An 'active' status indicates that the operator of a multi-tenant house holds an active licence. An 'in progress' status indicates that the operator is actively seeking a licence or renewal. An 'inactive' status indicates that the operator has let their licence expire and/or the operator has recently closed operations, but has yet to be confirmed by ML&S.

    For more information, please visit the Multi-Tenant (Rooming) Houses [website](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/housing-shelter/multi-tenant-rooming-houses/).

    Note: This dataset is refreshed daily between 12:00 p.m. and 1 p.m.
