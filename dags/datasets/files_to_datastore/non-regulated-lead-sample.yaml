  notes: |
    The City's Residential Lead Testing Program is a non-regulated program provided free of charge to residents concerned about the possibility of lead in their tap drinking water.
    
    Residents can pick up and drop off a water sample kit at one of six Toronto Public Health locations. While each kit contains detailed instructions on how to obtain an accurate tap water sample, the City of Toronto has no control over how or where a sample is obtained. Toronto Water provides lead test results to all residents who submit a test.
