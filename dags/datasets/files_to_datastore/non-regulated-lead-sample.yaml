  excerpt: Non Regulated Lead sample results reported to the client during a specified date range.
  limitations: null
  notes: |
    The City's Residential Lead Testing Program is a non-regulated program provided free of charge to residents concerned about the possibility of lead in their tap drinking water.
    
    Residents can pick up and drop off a water sample kit at one of six Toronto Public Health locations. While each kit contains detailed instructions on how to obtain an accurate tap water sample, the City of Toronto has no control over how or where a sample is obtained. Toronto Water provides lead test results to all residents who submit a test.
    
    To find out more about what the City is doing to reduce lead in drinking water, visit: [www.toronto.ca/leadpipes](http://www.toronto.ca/leadpipes)

              The Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change's Ontario Regulation 169/03 sets the maximum acceptable concentration of lead in drinking water at 0.010 milligrams per litre (mg/l) or 10 parts per billion (ppb).
