    Neighbourhood Improvement Areas are specially-selected and designated neighbourhoods
    in the City of Toronto found to have inequities on several indicators of well-being.
    Currently 31 out of 140 neighbourhoods are designated as NIAs as part of the Toronto
    Strong Neighbourhoods 2020 (TSNS2020) project. This dataset superceded the previous
    13 Priority Areas in April 2014. For further details please read the technical
    documentation found in the download package or visit www.toronto.ca/neighbourhoods.
    For a link to the older 13 Priority Areas used between 2005 and 2013, go here:
    [Priority Investment Neighbourhoods](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/priority-investment-neighbourhoods)


    Dataset is based on Statistics Canada''s 2011 Census Tracts, as found in the Census
    Dictionary and Reference Geography Maps. Area of coverage is the city of Toronto
    only. Dataset is based on Centreline dataset. This dataset works best with datasets
    with the same projection.
