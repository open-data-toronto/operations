  excerpt: This dataset includes aggregated format of all Level 3 and Level 4 searches that were conducted.
  limitations: |
    * Dependent on data entered into the Booking â€“ 3 Search of Person Text Template from Versadex
    * Filtered by Search Date
    * Cannot be broken down by division due to consistency issues with data entry
    * May include duplicates if multiple text templates entered for the same search

  notes: |
    This dataset includes all Level 3 and Level 4 searches that were conducted.

    In accordance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Toronto Police Service has taken the necessary measures to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the reported occurrences. No personal information related to any of the parties involved in the occurrence will be released as open data. 

    This data is aggregated by search year and criteria selection.

    There was a change in reporting effective October 2020. As a result, the type of item found during the search is not collected in a comparable manner. Now the information is identified as whether or not an object has been identified. This change has been reflected in the dataset.
