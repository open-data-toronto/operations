  excerpt: This dataset includes cycling volumes and classifications collected during the City of Toronto Bicycle Cordon Count studies carried out in 2010, 2013 and 2014.
  limitations: |
    * A Cordon Count only provides a count of people observed crossing the cordon boundary during the day, in either direction. It does not represent the total number of people cycling or using micromobility devices in the downtown area. The cordon count does not capture trips that start and end within the cordon boundary. Individuals could be counted crossing a count station multiple times within a day.
    * Cordon count data were collected on a single or several days, and there may be natural day-to-day variations in cycling volume that should be taken into consideration when comparing data year-over-year
    * Some cordon entrances and exits, typically low volume roads and/or trails were not counted due to resource limitations.
    * Cyclist characteristics are recorded as-perceived in real time by counting staff and are subject to human error and subjectivity of individual perception.
  notes: "The data in this repository was collected as part of the City of Toronto Bicycle Cordon Count studies carried out in 2010, 2013 and 2014. The dataset contains information on how many cyclists are riding on specific downtown streets, when and where they are riding, and other cyclist characteristics such as gender, sidewalk riding, helmet use, and transporting passengers. The locations included form a \"Cordon\" around the inner downtown core, bounded by Bloor Street, Spadina Avenue, Queen's Quay and Jarvis Street. \r\n\r\nCounts were conducted on one or several days in each study year, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. The Cordon Count was conducted in early fall. Mid-week, good weather days were chosen to best represent typical cycling and micromobility travel patterns.\r\n\r\nThe counts are separated by date, location, and direction, and aggregated to 15-minute bins. Count summary and 15-minute volume tables are included. For each 15-minute bin, total volume and the individual volumes broken down by cyclist characteristics are provided.\r\n\r\nThe 2010 Cordon Count data was previously published on Open Data in raw format and can be found at [https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bicycle-count-and-locations/](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bicycle-count-and-locations/). The 2013 and 2014 data have not previously been published. \r\n\r\nThe cordon count was restarted in 2022 and the data can be found at [2022 Bicycle and Micromobility Cordon Count] (https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bicycle-and-micromobility-cordon-count-2022)."
