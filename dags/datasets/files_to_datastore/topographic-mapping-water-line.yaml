  excerpt: Layer from the City’s topographic mapping products representing narrow waterways.
  limitations: Data is collected via manual digitization from aerial imagery. It has a ground accuracy of +/- 30cm. Added/deleted/moved features may not be reflected in the dataset immediately due to operational constraints. Due to the inability to see features located close to tall buildings, or in areas of deep shadow; some features may not be collected. Based on the sheer scale and physical area of the City of Toronto not all features are collected annually. This data is not to be used as a substitute for a legal survey. The data is to be used for analysis and visualization purposes.
  notes: |
    Line layer representing small waterways. These are for any waterways too narrow to accurately determine both banks of the waterway. For any waterway wide enough to determine both sides of the banks, please refer to the Topographic Mapping - Water Bodies and Rivers dataset.

    These lines are part of the City’s topographic mapping products, the data is collected from high resolution aerial photography. The data is a representation of the physical features that are visually identifiable in an aerial photograph.
