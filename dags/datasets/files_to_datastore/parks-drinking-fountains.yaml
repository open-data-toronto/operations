  notes: |
    This dataset includes data on drinking water sources (i.e. drinking fountains, bottle filling stations, dog fountains and combination units) operated by the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation (PFR) division. Only drinking water sources that have been deemed as operational at the time of data validation exercise are included in this dataset. Drinking water sources have a "turn on" and "turn off" time period (turn on - May and turn off - October) and do not function throughout the entire year. 

    The data provided is sourced from the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Asset Management System. The dataset has been validated by on-site parks supervisors and through necessary inter-divisional staff. 
    
    **Note**:  

    This dataset only contains information about drinking water sources operated by Parks, Forestry and Recreation division of the City of Toronto. All other City-owned drinking water sources are out of scope of this dataset.
