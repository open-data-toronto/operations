  excerpt: This dataset identifies the intersections in Toronto where red light cameras
    are located.
  limitations: null
  notes: "Red Light Camera (RLC) is an automated system which photographs vehicles\
    \ that run red lights. Generally, the camera is triggered when a vehicle enters\
    \ the intersection (passes the stop-bar) after the traffic signal has turned red.\
    \ The camera will take two time-stamped photographs of the vehicle: one is taken\
    \ as the vehicle approaches the stop line and the second is taken as the vehicle\
    \ moves through the intersection. RLC is focused on altering driver behaviour\
    \ to eliminate red-light running and increase safety for all road users. \r\n\r\
    \nThis dataset identifies the intersections in Toronto where Red Light Cameras\
    \ are located.\r\n\r\nFor a list of historical (including de-commissioned) locations,\
    \ please visit the Red Light Camera website or contact us at the email listed.\r\
