  notes: "\n\nThis dataset includes data on outdoor Artificial Ice Rinks (AIR) and\
    \ skate trails maintained by the City of Toronto PF&R Division.\n\nThere are about\
    \ 50 City of Toronto outdoor artificial ice rink locations.\n\nArtificial ice\
    \ rinks are located in parks, on playgrounds, building grounds, or at the squares.\
    \ The dataset provides details on ice rink size, whether the rink is lit or not,\
    \ and location information.\n\nEvery AIR is identified by (X, Y) GIS coordinate.\n\
    \n \n\nThus, outdoor artificial ice rinks and skate trails information you'll\
    \ find in this dataset is the following:\n\n  * Outdoor Artificial Ice Rink ID\n\
    \  * Asset Name\n  * Park Name  \n  * Public Name\n  * Rink Size     \n  * Lit\
    \ Area\n  * District        \n  * Ward           \n  * Address\n  * X, Y Coordinate\n\
    \n\n\n \n\nThe source of the data is the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry & Recreation\
    \ Asset Management System. Dataset has gone through necessary inter-divisional\
    \ validation and on-site validation with parks supervisors.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThe\
    \ dataset contains information about outdoor artificial ice rinks and skate trails\
    \ maintained by Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Division of the City of Toronto.\
    \ All other outdoor ice rinks and skate trails (either public, or private) are\
    \ out of scope of this dataset.\n\nValid date range of the data is 2016. As per\
    \ official opening of PFR outdoor artificial ice rinks in Fall/early Winter 2016,\
    \ the data has gone through necessary business validation. Some values may be\
    \ missing from the dataset. These will be added as data is captured and recorded\
    \ by PFR. Official refresh of the data is planned annually before or during AIR\
    \ openings.\n\nThe following rinks are under construction and/or are currently\
    \ closed. Data for this rinks may changes:\n\n  * 14291   QUEENSWAY RINK - Outdoor\
    \ Artificial Ice Rink\n  * 14290   PRINCE OF WALES RINK - Outdoor Artificial Ice\
    \ Rink\n  * 14297   RIVERDALE PARK EAST - Outdoor Artificial Ice Rink\n  * 60122\
    \   MCCOWAN DISTRICT PARK - Outdoor Artificial Ice Rink\n\n\n\n \n\nThe values\
    \ will be added as data is captured and recorded by PFR.\n"
