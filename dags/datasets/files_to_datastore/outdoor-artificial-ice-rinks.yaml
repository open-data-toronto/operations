    Artificial ice rinks are located in parks, on playgrounds, at Community Recreation Centres, and at Civic Centre Squares. The dataset provides details on location information, ice rink (i.e. pad) size and lighting conditions.

    *	Parent Asset Name
    *	Asset ID
    *	Asset Name
    *	Park Name
