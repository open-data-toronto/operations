  excerpt: 'This dataset contains information on outdoor artificial ice rinks and
    skate trails maintained by Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Division of the City
    of Toronto.'
  limitations: null
  notes: |
    This dataset includes data on outdoor Artificial Ice Rinks (AIR) and skate trails maintained by the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation (PFR) division.

    The City operates more than 50 locations with outdoor rinks and skating trails, consisting of approximately 70 ice pads and skating trails.
    
    Artificial ice rinks are located in parks, on playgrounds, at Community Recreation Centres, and at Civic Centre Squares. The dataset provides details on location information, ice rink (i.e. pad) size and lighting conditions. 
    
    The operational status of an outdoor artificial ice rink is updated in near real-time by staff throughout the day. The most updated information can be found by accessing the JSON file linked below:

    [https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/live/skate_allupdates.json](https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/live/skate_allupdates.json)

    Operational Statuses include:
    * 0 = closed
    * 1 = open
    * 2 = service alert

    The json file and the rink list should be joined by first parsing the numeric digits from the [locations] column in the json, and then joining to the rink file on [locationid]. Note: The json file will only show status information for ice pads that have active service alerts on them.
    
    The data provided is sourced from the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Asset Management System. The dataset has been validated on-site by parks supervisors and through necessary inter-divisional staff. 
    
    **Note**:
    
    This dataset only contains information about outdoor artificial ice rinks and skate trails maintained by Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division of the City of Toronto. Natural ice rinks are not included in this dataset and more information can be found on [Toronto.ca/rec](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/recreation/). All other outdoor ice rinks and skate trails (either public, or private) are out of scope of this dataset.
