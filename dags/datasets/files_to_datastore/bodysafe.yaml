  excerpt: This dataset contains the Personal Service Settings (PSS) annual health inspection results in accordance to the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care's Infection Prevention and Control Best Practices for Personal Services Settings.
  limitations: null
  notes: Starting July 1, 2013, under the revised [Municipal Code Chapter 545, Licensing By-Law](http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_545.pdf), all establishments offering hairstyling or barbering services were required to get a PSS licence and post their inspection notices at or near the entrance of the business, so that it is clearly visible to the public. All these establishments are included on the BodySafe website. Establishments offering other services such as tattooing, micropigmentation, ear and body piercing, electrolysis, manicures, pedicures and aesthetics will be phased in over the next few years.
