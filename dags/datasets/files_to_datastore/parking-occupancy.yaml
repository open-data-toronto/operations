    The Toronto Parking Authority (TPA) operates a portfolio of several City-owned off-street parking facilities.

            notes: "Average daily peak occupancy is the primary utilization metric employed by TPA. It is derived from paid parking transactions and calculated by taking the highest number of transactions recorded each day, dividing by location capacity to get a daily peak percentage, then averaging these percentages over the total number of days in the reported period (e.g., 90 days for a quarterly report)."
