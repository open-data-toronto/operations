  notes: |
    The following dataset includes properties that have been identified by City Council through a City-led study as having potential cultural heritage value or interest, that are not included on the City’s Heritage Register, and properties that were formerly included on the City’s Heritage Register and are believed to hold cultural heritage value or interest.  Development applications submitted for these properties must include a Cultural Heritage Resource Assessment in accordance with [Schedule 3](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/904d-cp-official-plan-Schedule-3.pdf) of the City’s Official Plan. This assessment will be used to assist the City in determining whether a property, collection of properties, or landscape feature has cultural heritage value.
