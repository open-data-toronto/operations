Included in the list are sports facilities, playgrounds, picnic areas, dog off-leash areas, etc. There are over 1500 records in the dataset.

    The operational status of a community recreation centre is updated in near real-time by staff throughout the day. The most updated information can be found by accessing the JSON file linked below:

    https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/live/centres.json

    Operational Statuses include:

    * 0 = closed
    * 1 = open
    * 2 = service alert

    Facilities within a centre such as pools or ice rinks have separate statuses and are not reflected in the community recreation centre status or the park status. Operational status of Parks is set to always Open.
