  excerpt: This dataset includes all Motor Vehicle Collision (MVC) occurrences by their occurrence date and related offences.

  limitations: |
    *	Filtered by occurrence date
    *	A single collision can apply to multiple collision types
    *	No Specified Address (NSA) includes any occurrences reported outside the City of Toronto limits or those that have no verified location
    *	Excludes cancelled and unfounded events

  notes: |
    This dataset includes all Motor Vehicle Collision (MVC) occurrences by their occurrence date and related offences. The MVC categories include property damage (PD) collisions, Fail to Remain (FTR) collisions, injury collisions and fatalities. This data is provided at the occurrence level, therefore multiple offences and/or victims can be associated with each record. This data does not include occurrences that have been deemed unfounded. The definition of unfounded according to Statistics Canada is: “It has been determined through police investigation that the offence reported did not occur, nor was it attempted” (Statistics Canada, 2020).

    In this dataset a collision is defined as the contact resulting from the motion of a motor vehicle or streetcar or its load, which produces property damage, injury or death. The term collision indicates that the initial point of contact involved at least one motor vehicle or streetcar.
