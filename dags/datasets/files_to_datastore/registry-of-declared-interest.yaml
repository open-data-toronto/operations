  notes: "Effective March 1, 2019, the [Municipal Conflict of Interest Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90m50),\
    \ requires municipalities to make a registry of declarations of interest available\
    \ for public inspection. These open data sets allow you to review the record of\
    \ declared interests for Members of Council.  \r\n\r\n\r\nVerbal declarations\
    \ are recorded and published as part of the minutes of each meeting. Changes to\
    \ the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act now require Members to submit a written\
    \ declaration in addition to making a verbal declaration. Both are captured in\
    \ this registry as of March 1, 2019. Records prior to March 1, 2019 contain only\
    \ verbal declarations and the Act does not require retroactive written declarations.\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n**Description of the data**\r\n\r\nThe declaration data for an item\
    \ becomes available when the minutes for a meeting have been published.\r\n\r\n\
    - **Committee**: The name of the committee, board or Council where the item was\
    \ considered and the declaration was made\r\n\r\n- **First Name**: First name\
    \ of Member\r\n\r\n- **Last Name**: Last name of Member  \r\n\r\n- **Item**: The\
    \ agenda item number as a hyperlink\r\n\r\n- **Item Title**: The agenda item title\r\
    \n\r\n- **Receive Date**: The receive date is the date the written declaration\
    \ was received by the Clerk.\r\n\r\n- **Verbal Declaration**: The verbal declaration\
    \ as recorded by the Clerk or board secretary\r\n\r\n- **Verbal Declaration Date**:\
    \ The date that the Member made the verbal declaration\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten declarations\
    \ are links to a PDF copy of the original written document presented to the Clerk.\

    \ Committee or Council team.\r\nMembers listed also include public Members appointed\
    \ to Boards by City Council.\r\n"
