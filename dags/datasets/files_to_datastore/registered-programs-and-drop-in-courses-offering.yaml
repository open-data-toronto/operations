  excerpt: This dataset contains information on City's registered and drop-in recreation
    programs and locations.
  limitations: null
  notes: "City of Toronto has a multitude of exciting programs for all ages. Whether\
    \ public is looking for swimming, fitness, skating, skiing, arts and crafts or\
    \ dance Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Division of the City of Toronto has something\
    \ for everyone.\r\n\r\nInformation presented in this dataset is used as data source\
    \ for [Parks, Forestry, and Recreation website](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/venues-facilities-bookings/booking-park-recreation-facilities/parks-and-recreation-facilities/).\
    \ For examples of registered and drop-in recreation programs at particular locations\
    \ please refer to: [Examples.](https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/prd/facilities/complex/85/index.html)\r\
    \n\r\n**Dataset contains 4 tabs:**\r\n\r\n  1. **Registered Programs**. Each row\
    \ of the spreadsheet describes a course of a registered program. Course_ID is\
    \ unique identifier. Recreational programs fall under various categories. A registered\
    \ program course runs under an activity, on schedule, and has boundaries in regards\
    \ age of a registrant. You can get information on course location from Locations\
    \ tab by LocationID. There are multiple courses running at one location.\r\n \
    \ 2. **Drop-in**. Each row of the spreadsheet describes a drop-in course. Drop-In\
    \ Course is a program offered within PFR facilities where registration is not\
    \ required. Drop-In Participation is an informal involvement in a program where\
    \ space may permit in an activity, and allow for a pay as you go option (e.g.\
    \ fitness class, Aquafit class). A drop-in course runs under a category, on schedule,\
    \ and has boundaries in regards age of registrants. You can get information on\
    \ course location from Locations tab by LocationID. There are multiple courses\
    \ running at one location.\r\n  3. **Locations**. Each row of the spreadsheet\
    \ describes a location. LocationID is unique identifier. A location has a name,\
    \ is characterized by a type (park, rec centre), address, and short description,\
    \ may be fully or partially accessible, and may have a parent location.\r\n  4.\
    \ **Facilities**. Each row of the spreadsheet describes a facility. FacilityID\
    \ is unique identifier. Facility is described by a Type (Display Name) and has\
    \ multiple assets. 'Facility Rating' column contains values of facility rates\
    \ (used to learn about amenities that might be available at each facility  - see\
    \ metadata). Facilities of some types can be permitted - 'Permit' column contains\
    \ information on necessary permit. You can get information on facility's location\
    \ from Locations tab by LocationID. Every location has multiple facilities.\r\n\
    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe source of the data is Parks, Forestry & Recreation SQL Server\
    \ database that combines information from the City of Toronto Recreation Management\
    \ System and Parks, Forestry & Recreation Asset Management System. The dataset\
    \ updates are scheduled daily **at 8:00 AM.**\r\n\r\n**Comments:  \r\n** The file\
    \ contains data on recreation programs presented in the City of Toronto Parks,\
    \ Forestry, and Recreation web site. The information in data repositories that\
    \ are sources for the website is updated on daily and reflects situation as of\
    \ **1 day** prior to dataset update. Changes might not be reflected right away\
    \ in the dataset due to processing lags. Examples of such are program cancellations,\
    \ community centres closures, locations change, etc. In cases where data changes\
    \ require additional time for implementation this gap may exceed 24 hours. The\
    \ Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Division makes every effort to keep this Open\
    \ Data set updated and accurate.\r\n"
