  excerpt: This dataset presents how Toronto's climate has changed in recent history, and what future climate conditions could look like for the remainder of the 21st century under two potential greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. 
  limitations: The information used in the production of this dataset represents the best information available to TRCA at the time the study was conducted (Summer 2024). The data is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, identity or ownership of data or information, or that the use of such data or information will not infringe any patent, intellectual property, or proprietary rights of any party.   
  notes: |
    This dataset was developed by Toronto and Region Conservation Authority for the City of Toronto.

    This data shows climate projections for 53 climate variables across two climate scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) and three future time periods (2015-2040, 2041- 2070, 2071-2100). This dataset represents the averages across the City of Toronto's municipal boundary area. Climate variables covering temperature, precipitation, extreme heat and cold days, dry days, agricultural variables, freeze-thaw cycles, and freezing rain potential are presented.
