  excerpt: This dataset contains bicycle and micromobility volumes from permanent bicycle detectors installed on Toronto streets and multi-use paths.
  limitations: |
    * The total counts are made up of bicycles and other micromobility devices including e-bikes, scooters, and e-scooters.

    * Only bicycles and other micromobility devices passing in the detection zone within the designated bicycle lane are counted. The volumes exclude riders on the sidewalk, in motor-vehicle lanes, or in painted buffer zones.

    * Detectors in operation since 2022 have been calibrated based on manual counts. Checks are done periodically to verify calibration. Data from older detectors that have since been replaced have been validated using historic data where available.

    * Many detectors were not active from 2019 to 2022 and have since been replaced.
  
  notes: |
    This dataset contains counts of bicycles from permanent detectors installed on Toronto streets and multi-use paths. The City uses the data to monitor trends in people cycling and the seasonal use of bicycle lanes. Additional new count stations are being added to the system and the data will be brought online when data validation is completed.

    The following files showing different views of the data are available:

    * **Detector Locations (cycling\_permanent\_counts\_locations)**: Location and metadata of each detector. This table references the [City of Toronto's Street Centreline](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-centreline-tcl/) dataset.

    * **Daily Counts (cycling\_permanent\_counts\_daily)**: Total daily counts by location and direction

    * **15-minute Counts (cycling\_permanent\_counts\_15min)**: 15-minute counts by direction and location. 1-hour counts are provided if 15-minute counts are not available.

    * **Readme and Data Dictionary (cycling\_permanent\_counts\_readme)**: Provides a detailed definition of each data table and it's corresponding columns.
