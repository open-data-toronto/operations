  notes: '


    Councillors who fulfill an official capacity with a municipal organization of
    which the City is a member are reimbursed from the Council Business Travel Budget
    for their travel costs related to Board and Committee meetings.  The Mayor, or
    a Councillor designated by Mayor to attend meetings and conferences of mayoral
    membership organizations will have the costs paid from the Council Business Travel
    Budget. Councillors who are not Board or Committee members of the Federation of
    Canadian Municipalities (FCM) and incur travel costs associated with attending
    the FCM Annual Conference may be reimbursed from the Council Business Travel Budget.
