  limitations: |
    The information represented in the spatial file must be read with the by-law text. It is suggested that these files be used with the [Toronto Centreline (TCL)](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-centreline-tcl/) and [Address Points (Municipal) - Toronto One Address Repository file](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/address-points-municipal-toronto-one-address-repository/).\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that without direct access to the text of the Zoning By-law, the mapped data is meaningless.  The current on-line zoning map is an interactive product which provides direct links to key parts of the text most relevant to the respective polygons.
