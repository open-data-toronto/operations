  excerpt: City-wide Zoning Bylaw No. 569-2013 regulates the use of land, the size and location of buildings and parking across the City.
  limitations: |
    The information represented in the spatial file must be read with the by-law text. It is suggested that these files be used with the [Toronto Centreline (TCL)](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-centreline-tcl/) and [Address Points (Municipal) - Toronto One Address Repository file](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/address-points-municipal-toronto-one-address-repository/).\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that without direct access to the text of the Zoning By-law, the mapped data is meaningless.  The current on-line zoning map is an interactive product which provides direct links to key parts of the text most relevant to the respective polygons.
  notes: |
      This dataset contains ESRI shape files that are part of the Zoning By-law 569-2013, was approved by Council but it is still subject to an Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) hearing for final approval.  
      The Zoning By-law team is responsible for the revising the city-wide zoning bylaw. Zoning bylaws regulate the use, size, height, density and location of buildings on properties and affect every property in the City.
