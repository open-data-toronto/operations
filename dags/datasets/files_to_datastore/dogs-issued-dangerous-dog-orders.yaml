  excerpt: Dogs who have received a Dangerous Dog Order are included in this list.  A
    Dangerous Dog Order is issued to a dog who has committed a severe dangerous act
    or has a second or subsequent dangerous act on record with the City of Toronto.
  limitations: Where possible, dogs that no longer reside within the noted forward sorting area (first 3 characters of a postal code), no longer reside in Toronto, or have died, will be removed from this data set. 
  notes: |
    Dangerous Dog Orders issued to dogs by the City of Toronto that are currently active will be listed here. A Dangerous Dog Order is issued when it is confirmed that a dangerous act (Any bite, attack, act of menacing behaviour or any combination of a bite, attack or act of menacing behaviour.) has occurred and the act is deemed severe or is the second consecutive act on record. This data set is updated monthly.
