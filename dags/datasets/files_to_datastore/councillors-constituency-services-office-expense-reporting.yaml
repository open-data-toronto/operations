    For 2018, the data is divided:
    
    * One part with data for the 44 wards up to November 30, 2018 including the Mayor's Office data for the full year

    Please Note:
    2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022 are election years so the Constituency Services and Office Budget is a pro-rated amount based on the number of months or partial months in each term of office. Re-elected Councillors have available to them the balance of funds remaining as of Election Day except when there are changes to ward boundaries, where the pro-rated amounts for both terms will apply to all Councillors.

    * $46,241.25 for January 1 - November 30, 2010; $4,203.75 for December 2010
