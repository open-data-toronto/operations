    This sewer dataset cannot be presented as part of a development, infrastructure or engineering planning or design application. Requests for official sewer and water infrastructure maps must follow the process stipulated on the [City's Utility Maps & Engineering Drawings](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/utility-maps-engineering-drawings/) website.
    
    The Data Preview in this dataset shows a sample of the data. The full dataset is available in the downloaded file.
    
  notes: This dataset provides pertinent information on the location of sewer system junctions connections, as well as classification by flow medium. The data is updated on a continual daily basis. The data is intended to support development and growth by facilitating pre-application discussions and preparation of servicing reports by Developers (and their teams).
