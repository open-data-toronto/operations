  excerpt: This dataset shows the annual visits at Toronto Public Library branches.
  limitations: Visits totals are sometimes estimated during periods when sensor issues have prevented proper data collection.   
  notes: |
    This dataset shows the annual visits at Toronto Public Library branches. Visits are generally counted using 
    sensors located at branch entrances and this activity is recorded during scheduled operating hours. Visits are 
    based on entries and may count the same individuals multiple times in a day if they leave and re-enter a 
    branch at a later point in time.

    The BKONE branch code is used to represent the combined visits for both bookmobiles.
