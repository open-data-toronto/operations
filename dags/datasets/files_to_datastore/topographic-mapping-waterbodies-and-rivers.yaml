  excerpt: Layer from the City’s topographic mapping products representing the physical area of waterbodies and rivers.
  limitations: Data is collected via manual digitization from aerial imagery. It has a ground accuracy of +/- 30cm. Added/deleted/moved features may not be reflected in the dataset immediately due to operational constraints. Due to the inability to see features located close to tall buildings, or in areas of deep shadow; some features may not be collected. Based on the sheer scale and physical area of the City of Toronto not all features are collected annually. This data is not to be used as a substitute for a legal survey. The data is to be used for analysis and visualization purposes.
  notes: |
    Polygon layer representing the physical area of waterbodies and rivers. Some features contain an attribute defining their name. Names are defined from the Ontario Geographic Names Board [Geographic names | ontario.ca](https://www.ontario.ca/page/geographic-names)

    These polygons Part of the City’s topographic mapping products, the data is collected from high resolution aerial photography. The data is a representation of the physical features that are visually identifiable in an aerial photograph.
