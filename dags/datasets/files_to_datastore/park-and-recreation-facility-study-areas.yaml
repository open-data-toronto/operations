  excerpt: This dataset contains location data and a brief summary of studies which
    are currently underway and the plans and strategies which guide park and recreation
    facilities improvement projects.
  limitations: "-\tThe dataset does not include planned projects which have not yet\
    \ been initiated. -\t[project\_name], [project\_url], and/or [description] attributes\
    \ may change over time if a project which began as a study becomes a plan or a\
    \ strategy."
  notes: Parks, Forestry and Recreation develops plans and strategies to help guide
    how we invest in parks and recreation facilities. These plans and strategies are
    informed by studies which investigate how communities are being served by their
    parks and recreation facilities.
