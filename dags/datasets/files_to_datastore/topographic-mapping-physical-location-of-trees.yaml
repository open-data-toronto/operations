  excerpt: "Layer from the City\u2019s topographic mapping products representing the\
    \ physical location of trees."
  limitations: "Data is collected via automated extraction from aerial LiDAR using\
    \ custom developed procedures using open source tools. The City is currently in\
    \ the process of publishing these methodologies for public use. This code is deemed\
    \ \u201Cin development\u201D and therefore the quality/accuracy of the derived\
    \ tree points layer will improve with time. Added/deleted/moved features may not\
    \ be reflected in the dataset immediately due to operational constraints. Due\
    \ to the inability to see features located close to tall buildings, or in areas\
    \ of deep shadow; some features may not be collected. This data is not to be used\
    \ as a substitute for a legal survey. The data is to be used for analysis and\
    \ visualization purposes."
  notes: "Point layer representing the physical location of trees. Part of the City\u2019\
    s topographic mapping products, the data is collected from high resolution aerial\
    \ photography. The data is a representation of the physical features that are\
    \ visually identifiable in an aerial photograph. "
