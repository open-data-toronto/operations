    The dataset contains information about indoor ice rinks owned by the City of Toronto and operated by either by the Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Division or another City of Toronto Corporation or Agency. All other indoor ice rinks (either public access, or private) are out of scope of this dataset.
    **Lakeshore Arena Corporation:** 
    The Lakeshore Arena Corporation is a City corporation that manages the Lakeshore Arena (operating as the Ford Performance Centre), a marquee four-pad ice arena in the South Etobicoke area of Toronto. The Lakeshore Arena offers ice rentals, leagues, public skating, drop-in programs, tournaments and special events to the local community. 
    **Arena Boards:**
    Eight arenas in Toronto are operated by volunteer Arena Boards of Management (Arena Boards). The board-run arenas provide indoor ice sport facilities and other recreational spaces such as community rooms and banquet halls. Programs offered include hockey and figure skating and leisure skating. Some arenas also offer dry floor rentals (i.e., floor hockey) in the summer. These services are complemented by snack bars, pro-shops, and meeting rooms rentals at some locations.
