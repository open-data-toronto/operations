  excerpt: This dataset contains information on arenas, community centres, and recreation centres with indoor ice rinks, operated by Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Division of the City of Toronto.
  limitations: null
  notes: |
    This dataset includes information on arenas, community centres, and recreation centres with indoor ice pads owned by the City of Toronto.
    
    The dataset provides details on ice pad size according to Hockey Canada Line Markings diagrams approved by Hockey Canada, and location information.

    The operational status of an indoor ice rink is updated in near real-time by staff throughout the day. The most updated information can be found by accessing the JSON file linked below:
    
    [https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/live/skate_allupdates.json](https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/live/skate_allupdates.json)
    
    Operational Statuses include:
    *	0 = closed
    *	1 = open
    *	2 = service alert

    The json file and the rink list should be joined by first parsing the numeric digits from the [locations] column in the json, and then joining to the rink file on [locationid]. Note: The json file will only show status information for ice pads that have active service alerts on them.
    
    **Note:**
    The dataset contains information about indoor ice rinks owned by the City of Toronto and operated by either by the Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Division or another City of Toronto Corporation or Agency. All other indoor ice rinks (either public access, or private) are out of scope of this dataset.
    
    **Lakeshore Arena Corporation:** 
    The Lakeshore Arena Corporation is a City corporation that manages the Lakeshore Arena (operating as the Ford Performance Centre), a marquee four-pad ice arena in the South Etobicoke area of Toronto. The Lakeshore Arena offers ice rentals, leagues, public skating, drop-in programs, tournaments and special events to the local community. 
    
    **Arena Boards:**
    Eight arenas in Toronto are operated by volunteer Arena Boards of Management (Arena Boards). The board-run arenas provide indoor ice sport facilities and other recreational spaces such as community rooms and banquet halls. Programs offered include hockey and figure skating and leisure skating. Some arenas also offer dry floor rentals (i.e., floor hockey) in the summer. These services are complemented by snack bars, pro-shops, and meeting rooms rentals at some locations.
