  notes: "A Business Improvement Area (BIA) is an association of commercial property\r\
    \nowners and tenants within a defined area who work in partnership with the City\r\
    \nto create thriving, competitive, and safe business areas that attract\r\nshoppers,\
    \ diners, tourists, and new businesses.  The BIA layer represents the\r\nactive\
    \ BIAs in the City of Toronto that has been enacted by Council.  Each BIA\r\n\
    has been defined by a by-law and is represented by a Board of Management.  The\r\
    \nlayer is updated as BIAs are created, amended or deleted by Council. This file\r\
    \nis a polygon file and is best utilized with the Toronto Street Centreline\r\n\
    Dataset.\r\n\r\n"
