  excerpt: This dataset is a list of addresses that may be eligible to receive a rent
    decrease due to a property tax decrease of 2.5% or more between two consecutive
    years.

  limitations: This data is updated in December annually.
  notes: |
    See attached for readme file.
    The Residential Tenancies Act (RTA) allows residential tenants to reduce their rents when the rental properties in which they live have had a property tax decrease of more than 2.49%.
    The Act also requests that the City send notices to the landlords and tenants of the affected properties to inform about the rent reduction.
    
    Visit us on the Web for more information about the Residential Reduction Program at
    
    [www.toronto.ca/taxes/rent_reduction](http://www.toronto.ca/taxes/rent_reduction)
    Property value assessments are established by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation. The City of Toronto is provided with this information to determine the property tax rates for residential buildings.
    Reasons for Notices Not Mailed:
    (i)     Property taxes from 2021 to 2022 either increased or did not change.
    (ii)    Property taxes from 2021 to 2022 were reduced by less than 2.5%.  No notices will be sent from the City. Tenants cannot automatically reduce their rent and must apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board for the rent reduction.
    (iii)   No notice is required if a property is exempt from the rent reduction provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act (s.131)
