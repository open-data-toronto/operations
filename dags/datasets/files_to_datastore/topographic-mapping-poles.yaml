  excerpt: "Photogrammetrically derived point dataset of pole features.\t\t"
  limitations: null
  notes: "\n\nTopographic mapping includes features that are visible on the ground\
    \ (planimetric), or can be derived from photogrammetric measurements. The pole\
    \ dataset is broken down into the following subtypes:\n\n \n\n- Circular Hydro\
    \ Tower\n\n- Pedestrian Light Pole\n\n- Street Light Pole\n\n- Street Light and\
    \ Traffic Signal Pole\n\n- Traffic Signal Pole\n\n- Miscellaneous Pole\n\n \n\n\
    **Limitation:**\n\nData is collected via manual digitization from aerial imagery.\
    \ It has a ground accuracy of +- 30cm. Poles added/deleted/moved through construction\
    \ may not be reflected in the dataset immediately due to operational constraints.\
    \ Due to the inability to see poles located close to tall buildings, or in areas\
    \ of deep shadow; some poles may not be collected at all.\n"
