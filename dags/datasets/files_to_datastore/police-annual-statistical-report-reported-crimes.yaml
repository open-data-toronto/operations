    This dataset includes all reported crime offences by reported date aggregated by division. This data includes all crimes reported to the Toronto Police Service, including, but not limited to, those that may have been deemed unfounded after investigation, those that may have occurred outside the City of Toronto limits, or those that have no verified location. 

    In accordance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Toronto Police Service has taken the necessary measures to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the reported occurrences. No personal information related to any of the parties involved in the occurrence will be released as open data. The data has been aggregated by year, category, subtype and geographic police division.

    If an occurrence is categorized as multiple offence types, it would be included in multiple categories. The counts presented do not indicate the number of distinct occurrences.
