    The Torontoâ€™s Police Service Annual Statistical Report (ASR) is a comprehensive overview of police related statistics including reported crimes, victims of crime, search of persons, firearms, traffic collisions, personnel, budget, communications, public complaints, regulated interactions and other administrative information. 

    This specific dataset includes all reported crime offences from 2014 to 2019 by reported date aggregated by division. This data includes all crimes reported to the Toronto Police Service, including, but not limited to, those that may have been deemed unfounded after investigation, those that may have occurred outside the City of Toronto limits, or those that have no verified location. 

    In accordance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Toronto Police Service has taken the necessary measures to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the reported occurrences. No personal information related to any of the parties involved in the occurrence will be released as open data. The data has been aggregated by year, category, subtype and geographic division.

    If an occurrence is categorized as multiple offence types, it would be included in multiple categories. The count presented do not indicate the number of distinct occurrences.

    This data is related to table (ASR-RC-TBL-001) in [The Annual Statistical Report](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/annualstatisticalreport).
