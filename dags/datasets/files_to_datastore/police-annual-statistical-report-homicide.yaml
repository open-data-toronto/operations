  excerpt: This dataset includes all Homicides occurrences by occurred date.
  limitations: |
    This dataset includes all Homicides from 2004 to 2020.  The location of crime occurrences have been deliberately offset to the nearest road intersection node to protect the privacy of parties involved in the occurrence. Due to the offset of occurrence location, the numbers by Division and Neighbourhood may not reflect the exact count of occurrences reported within these geographies. Therefore, the Toronto Police Service does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness of the data and it should not be compared to any other source of crime data. Divisional Boundary changes took effect in 2011.

    This data is related to table (ASR-RC-TBL-002) in [The Annual Statistical Report](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/annualstatisticalreport).

    Additional information can be found [here](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/asr-resources).
  notes: |
    This dataset includes all Homicides occurrences by occurred date.

    Note: Fields have been included for both the old 140 City of Toronto Neighbourhoods structure as well as the new 158 City of Toronto Neighbourhoods structure
