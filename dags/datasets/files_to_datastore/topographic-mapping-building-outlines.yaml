  excerpt: Layer from the City’s topographic mapping products representing the physical area of buildings.
  limitations: Data is collected via manual digitization from aerial imagery. It has a ground accuracy of +/- 30cm. Added/deleted/moved features may not be reflected in the dataset immediately due to operational constraints. Due to the inability to see features located close to tall buildings, or in areas of deep shadow; some features may not be collected. Based on the sheer scale and physical area of the City of Toronto not all features are collected annually. This data is not to be used as a substitute for a legal survey. The data is to be used for analysis and visualization purposes.
  notes: |
    Polygon layer representing the physical area of buildings. Building polygon collection is split into two “classes”. 

      - Simple buildings are buildings which are 3 storeys or less. These building polygons will be collected at the outer extents of the roof. 

      - Complex buildings are collected as multiple overlapping polygons representing the extents of individual roof elevations. Rooftop structures (i.e. Elevator rooms, air conditioning structures) may be collected as well.

    These polygons Part of the City’s topographic mapping products, the data is collected from high resolution aerial photography. The data is a representation of the physical features that are visually identifiable in an aerial photograph.
