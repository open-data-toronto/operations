  excerpt: Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 395, Clothing Drop Boxes, requires that
    all clothing drop boxes placed on private or public property display a permit.
    This dataset provides information on businesses that own permits for clothing
    drop boxes and the locations of the drop boxes.
  limitations: "- This data set contains all clothing drop box permits issued from\
    \ October 1st, 2019 onward.  Cancelled permits will have a date in the \"Cancellation\
    \ Date\" field.\r\n\r\n- Earlier permit data can be found in this data set: [\"\
    Municipal Licensing and Standards - Business Licences and Permits\"](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/municipal-licensing-and-standards-business-licences-and-permits/).\
    \  Filter for \"CLOTHING DROP BOX LOCATION PERMIT\" \u2013 the permit numbers\
    \ will start with \"P90\".\r\n\r\n- Each clothing drop box operator must also\
    \ hold a \"Clothing Drop Box Operator\" business licence.  Those licences can\
    \ be found in this data set: [\"Municipal Licensing and Standards - Business Licences\
    \ and Permits\"](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/municipal-licensing-and-standards-business-licences-and-permits/).\
    \  Filter for \"CLOTHING DROP BOX OPERATOR\" \u2013 the licence numbers will start\
    \ with \"B90\".\r\n\r\n- Investigation activity (such as complaints or service\
    \ requests related to clothing drop boxes and collected through 311) is not available\
    \ in this set or in the [\"Municipal Licensing and Standards - Investigation Activity\"\
    ](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/municipal-licensing-and-standards-investigation-activity/)\
    \ and the [\"311 Service Requests\"](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/311-service-requests-customer-initiated/)\
    \ data sets.\r\n"
  notes: "This dataset provides information on the location and operators of permitted\
    \ clothing drop boxes.\r\n\r\nThe Clothing Drop Box by-law ensures that the public\
    \ is aware of where used clothing donations are going, creates a registry of clothing\
    \ box owners, and deters litter and unsightly views for residents.\r\n\r\nToronto\
    \ Municipal Code [Chapter 395](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/bylaws/2013/law0599.pdf),\
    \ \"Clothing Drop Boxes\", requires that all clothing drop box operators obtain\
    \ a location permit for each box. All operators, including charitable organizations,\
    \ must display the permit sticker on the box. \r\n\r\n\r\n* For more information\
    \ refer to the [clothing drop box operator licence](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/permits-licences-bylaws/clothing-drop-box-operator-licence/?t=1568037891)\
