  excerpt: This data set provides a point representation for addresses within the
    City of Toronto.
  limitations: "As part of our State of Good Repair project and data quality improvements,\
    \ the Geospatial Competency Centre has removed a few deprecated attributes from\
    \ our ADDRESS and ADDRESS_POINT dataset, and their associated web map services.\r\
    \n\r\nThese attributes are *GENERALUSE* and *GENERALUSE_CODE* (also known as Feature\
    \ Code and Feature Code Description). These two attributes are based on a historic\
    \ dataset, have not been regularly maintained, and have no reliable, affordable\
    \ sources for continued update.\r\n\r\nDue to these factors, these attributes\
    \ were nullified (made blank) on Thursday, July 29, 2021. It is important to note\
    \ that the attribute columns will remain in the database to ensure this change\
    \ does not affect existing applications, however there will be no values in them.\r\
    \n"
  notes: "The One Address Repository data set provides a point representation for\
    \ over 500,000 addresses within the City of Toronto. Each address point is described\
    \ with a series of attributes including street number, street name, address type,\
    \ feature class and real world coordinates.\r\n\r\nAll address points have a position\
    \ on the correct side of the street, and are correctly positioned relative to\
    \ neighbouring addresses. They are positioned within the parcel or the building\
    \ footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
