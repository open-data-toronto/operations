  excerpt: Layer from the Cityâ€™s topographic mapping products representing the physical area of buildings.
  limitations: Data is collected via manual digitization from aerial imagery. It has a ground accuracy of +/- 30cm. Added/deleted/moved features may not be reflected in the dataset immediately due to operational constraints. Due to the inability to see features located close to tall buildings, or in areas of deep shadow; some features may not be collected. Based on the sheer scale and physical area of the City of Toronto not all features are collected annually. This data is not to be used as a substitute for a legal survey. The data is to be used for analysis and visualization purposes.
  notes: |
    This data outlines the geographical area of all properties in the City of Toronto. While every attempt is made to keep this dataset up to date, it has been compiled over many years, from numerous records of varying age and reliability. As such, the resulting accuracy of the boundary mapping information renders it suitable for general planning purposes only and is not a substitute for a plan of survey.

    Column Definition + OBJECTID represents a unique identifier. It is not guaranteed to be consistent between data updates.
