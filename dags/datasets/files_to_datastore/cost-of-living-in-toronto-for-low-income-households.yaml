  excerpt: 'Low-income households struggle to pay for the basic costs of living. These
    income scenarios describe affordability of shelter, nutritious food, childcare
    and transportation relative to income. '
  limitations: "+\tScenarios describe estimated values only, rounded to the nearest\
    \ dollar.\r\n+\tIncome is estimated using a May/June 2022 reference period to\
    \ align with Nutritious Food Basket data collection. Thus, tax year 2020 has been\
    \ utilized in calculations.\r\n+\tIncome amounts include all entitlements available\
    \ to Ontario residents; therefore, they are maximum amounts. Actual income amounts\
    \ may be lower if residents do not file their income tax and/or do not apply for\
    \ all available tax credits.\r\n"
  notes: "The City of Toronto monitors the affordability of food annually using the\
    \ Nutritious Food Basket (NFB) costing tool. While food prices have increased\
    \ considerably in recent months, the inability to purchase food is not because\
    \ food prices are too high. Rather, people with low incomes do not have enough\
    \ money to cover the cost of basic expenses, including nutritious food.  As such,\
    \ NFB data is best viewed in relation to income, alongside other local basic expenses.\
    \  \r\n\r\nThe dataset describes the affordability of food and other basic expenses\
    \ relative to income for nine household scenarios. \r\n\r\n+\tScenarios were selected\
    \ to reflect household characteristics that increase the risk of being food insecure,\
    \ including reliance on social assistance as the main source of income, single-parent\
    \ households, and rental housing. A median income scenario has also been included\
    \ as a comparator. \r\n+\tIncome, including federal and provincial tax benefits,\
    \ and the cost of four basic living expenses - shelter, food, childcare, and transportation\
    \ - are estimated for each scenario. \r\n+\tResults show the amount of money remaining\
    \ at the end of the month for each household. \r\n\r\nThree versions of the scenarios\
    \ were created to describe:\r\n\r\n+\tIncome scenarios with subsidies: Subsidies\
    \ can substantially reduce a households\u2019 monthly expenses. Local subsidies\
    \ for rent (Rent-Geared-to-Income), childcare (Childcare Fee Subsidy), and transit\
    \ (Fair Pass) are accounted for in this file. \r\n+\tIncome scenarios without\
    \ subsidies + average rent: In this file, rental costs are based on average rent,\
    \ as measured by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). \r\n+\t\
    Income scenarios without subsidies + market rent: Rental costs are based on average\
    \ market rent (as of June 2022), as measured by the Toronto Regional Real Estate\
    \ Board (TRREB).\r\n"
