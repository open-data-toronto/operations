  excerpt: This data is based on the sidewalk inventory from Transportation Services,
    Toronto road centrelines, and manual collection from aerial imagery. Pednet is
    integrated with centerline intersections, traffic signals, pedestrian crosswalks
    and crossovers, traffic signal data from Transportation Services as well as other
    City of Toronto datasets.
  limitations: 'Pednet is focused on topological accuracy, over geographic accuracy
    and has known limitations in completeness and classifications. This was an attempt
    to semi-automate the creation of a pedestrian network model for accessibility
    routing. '
  notes: "The Pedestrian Network (pednet) was created by the DAV team at the City\
    \ of Toronto, and it is based on the sidewalk inventory from Transportation Services,\
    \ Toronto road centrelines, and manual collection from aerial imagery. Pednet\
    \ is integrated with centerline intersections, traffic signals, pedestrian crosswalks\
    \ and crossovers, traffic signal data from Transportation Services as well as\
    \ other City of Toronto datasets.\r\n\r\nPednet was built using a variety of open\
    \ source libraries such as NetworkX, Pandana, Quantum GIS, and Space syntax, as\
    \ well as production mapping tools from ESRI\u2019s ArcPro/ArcMap. The project\
    \ source code can be found on DAV\u2019s GitHub account here, which includes the\
    \ semi-automated offsetting method from the Sidewalk Inventory and the analytical\
    \ procedures undertaken.\r\n\r\nPednet is a data model resembling a network graph\
    \ (edges and nodes) weighted by linear distance. Shortest routes were calculated\
    \ from every building centroid in the city to the nearest nth amenity at the maximum\
    \ distance of 5000m. Walk times were calculated in the nearest minutes, using\
    \ the prescribed 1.0m/per-second velocity used by Transportation services. Two\
    \ separate versions of pednet were created in this iteration of the project: \r\
    \n\r\n1) using actual linear distances as network weights, and \r\n\r\n2) where\
    \ crosswalks were \u201Cextended\u201D by 20% of their length to impose additional\
    \ impedance to their distances and walk times. \r\n\r\nFor every address within\
    \ the City of Toronto, the walk times were calculated to various amenities like\
    \ schools, libraries, hospitals, supermarkets, TTC stops and convenience stores\
    \ see Section 3. Walk times were assigned to individual addresses as attributes.\
    \ We then aggregated all these walk times to the census tract level and calculated\
    \ the minimum, maximum, standard deviation, median, and average walk times. We\
    \ used these aggregated values to both: \r\n\r\n1) relate walkability measures\
    \ to Statistics Canada Census data for socio-demographic analysis, as well as\
    \ \r\n\r\n2) the building footprints, pednet centerlines, and census tract area\
    \ boundaries to be used in choropleth maps contained within the following sections."
