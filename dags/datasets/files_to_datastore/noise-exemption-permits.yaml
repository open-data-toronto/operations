  notes: |  
    The Noise Bylaw provides standards for noise in Toronto. This includes decibel
    limits and time restrictions for some types of noise. Individuals and organizations
    can apply for a noise exemption permit for specific events or activities that
    may be in contravention of the Noise Bylaw if all application requirements are
    met.

    This dataset includes all noise exemption permits issued as of January 1, 2024, as well as any active permits that were issued prior to this date.
