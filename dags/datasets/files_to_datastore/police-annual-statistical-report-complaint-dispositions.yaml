  excerpt: This dataset provides a breakdown of the total investigated complaints by disposition of the complaint submitted between 2014 and 2019.
  limitations: Data pertains to external public complaints that have been received by PRS and entered in PSIS as of the data extraction date. Data pertains to TPS uniform members only. Numbers are subject to change as the data in PSIS is frequently being updated as complaints are concluded. The Disposition subtype of “Over 6 Months” was replaced by “Discontinued” in 2015.
