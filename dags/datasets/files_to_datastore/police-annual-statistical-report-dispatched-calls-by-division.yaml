  excerpt: This dataset provides a count of the dispatched calls by division.
  limitations: |
    *	PRIME and Parking Events are shown as separate counts and a final combined TPS, PRIME and Parking Total Count is provided for the Communications Services perspective of Total Dispatched Events.  
    *	The count for “Other” Dispatched Events is comprised of events with a valid call for service event type that are dispatched to a valid call sign where a Division reference could not be readily determined. (Example:  TPS officer attends an address outside of the city or a location that is not verified and attributed to a TPS Division.)
    *	All Administrative, Field Administrative Events, Duplicate, Cancel, and Filed Events are excluded.

  notes: |
    This dataset provides a count of the dispatched calls by division, including some specific units such as PRIME, Parking and “Other”. This data includes the command level at the time of reporting.
