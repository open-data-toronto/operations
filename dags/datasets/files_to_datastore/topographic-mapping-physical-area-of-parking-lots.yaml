  excerpt: "Layer from the City\u2019s topographic mapping products representing the\
    \ physical area of parking lots."
  limitations: Data is collected via manual digitization from aerial imagery. It has
    a ground accuracy of +/- 30cm. Added/deleted/moved features may not be reflected
    in the dataset immediately due to operational constraints. Due to the inability
    to see features located close to tall buildings, or in areas of deep shadow; some
    features may not be collected. Based on the sheer scale and physical area of the
    City of Toronto not all features are collected annually. This data is not to be
    used as a substitute for a legal survey. The data is to be used for analysis and
    visualization purposes.
  notes: "Polygon layer representing the physical area of parking lots. Part of the\
    \ City\u2019s topographic mapping products, the data is collected from high resolution\
    \ aerial photography. The data is a representation of the physical features that\
    \ are visually identifiable in an aerial photograph. "
