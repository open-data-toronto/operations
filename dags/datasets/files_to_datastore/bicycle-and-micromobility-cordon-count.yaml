  excerpt: This dataset includes micromobility counts and classifications collected during the City of Toronto Bicycle and Micromobility Cordon Count study carried out in 2022.
  limitations: |
    * A Cordon Count only provides a count of people observed crossing the cordon boundary during the day, in either direction. It does not represent the total number of people cycling or using micromobility devices in the downtown area. The cordon count does not capture trips that start and end within the cordon boundary. Individuals could be counted crossing a count station multiple times within a day or an individual trip.
    * Since cordon count data were collected on a single day, natural day-to-day variations in cycling volume should be taken into consideration when comparing data between the two cordons or year-over-year.
    * Some cordon boundary crossings, typically low volume roads or trails, were excluded from the cordon count due to resource limitations.
    * Classifications were determined by staff viewing videos of the street and are subject to human error and subjectivity of individual perception.
  notes: |
    The data in this repository were collected as part of the 2022 Toronto Micromobility Cordon and Classification Count. The dataset contains information on how many cyclists and micromobility users are riding on specific downtown streets, when and where they are riding, and other characteristics such as device type, apparent trip purpose, and whether they are riding in a bicycle lane, in mixed-traffic, or on the sidewalk.

    Seven screenlines that together make up two cordon boundaries were included in the study. The inner cordon is bounded by Bloor Street, Spadina Avenue, Queen's Quay and Jarvis Street. The outer cordon is bounded by Dufferin Street, the CP Rail Corridor (mostly parallel with Dupont Street), the Don River, and Lake Ontario. A few additional count locations not on cordon boundaries were also included to capture key high-volume locations. 

    Each cordon was counted on a single day, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. The Cordon Count was conducted in early fall. Mid-week, good weather days were chosen to best represent typical weekday cycling and micromobility travel patterns.

    The counts are separated by date, location, and direction of travel. A count summary table, a table of disaggregated counts and classifications, and a classification dictionary table are included. The data are fully anonymous.

    A report on the findings of the 2022 Bicycle and Micromobility Cordon Count is available at [Cycling Data, Events & Programs](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/cycling-events-and-programs).
