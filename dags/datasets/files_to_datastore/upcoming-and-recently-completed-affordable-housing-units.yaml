    homes that are in development in the City of Toronto and that have received an

  notes: This dataset corresponds with a map and contains upcoming and recently completed
    affordable rental homes that are in development in the City of Toronto and that
    have received an initial approval from City Council either for financial incentives
    through City housing programs (e.g., Open Door, Housing Now) or through a redevelopment
    application, and that are not yet occupied. The dataset highlights affordable
    rental homes that are still at a pre-construction stage of the development process,
    homes that are currently under construction and homes that have been recently
    completed.
