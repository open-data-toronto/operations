  limitations: null
  notes: |
    This section contains data on upcoming affordable rental homes that are in development and have received an approval from City Council either as initial approval for financial incentives through a City housing program (for example, Open Door, Housing Now, etc.) or as part of a development application (for example, through the former Section 37 density bonusing regulation, Community Benefits Charge, etc.), since January 1, 2017. The data highlights affordable rental homes that are still in the pre-construction stage of the development process, homes that are currently under construction, and homes that have been recently completed.
    These affordable rental homes meet the City's current definition of affordable rental housing, with rent, including utilities, at or below 100 per cent of Average Market Rent (AMR).
