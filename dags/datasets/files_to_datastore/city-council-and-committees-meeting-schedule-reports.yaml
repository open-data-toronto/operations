  notes: "This open data set provides access to meeting schedule data extracted from\
    \ TMMIS. You can also access previous term meeting schedule data.\r\nCity Council\
    \ approves an annual meeting schedule for City Council, Committees and Community\
    \ Councils.  Agencies, boards, tribunals and advisory bodies schedule their meetings\
    \ around the Council approved schedule.  \r\n\r\nThe City Council meeting schedule\
    \ is updated in real-time and always reflects the most accurate meeting information.\r\
    \n\r\nThe open data set includes the date, start time and name of meeting.  The\
    \ end time of the meeting is not reflective of how long a meeting will run; meetings\
    \ are complete when all agenda items have been considered.\r\n\r\nIf you want\
    \ to download the meeting data and upload to your calendar, use the following\
    \ [instructions](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/tmmis/calendarupload.pdf).  Please\
    \ note the meeting details are static once uploaded; they will not be automatically\
    \ updated if the meeting is rescheduled or canceled."
