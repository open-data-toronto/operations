  notes: |
    The Green Roof By-law was adopted by Toronto City Council May 2009 under the authority of section 108 of the City of Toronto Act. Toronto is the first city in North America to have a by-law requiring and governing the construction of green roofs. The bylaw applies to new commercial, institutional and many residential development applications and to certain developments not completed before the bylaw came into effect on Jan 31, 2010
