  excerpt: Road resurfacing consists of removing the top layer of asphalt and replacing that with new material.
  limitations: This data is meant to be used for planning purposes; it doesn't guarantee that the work is going to proceed.
  notes: |
    This data shows the currently active, planned, or completed road resurfacing projects.

    Road resurfacing consists of the replacement of old asphalt surface with new asphalt surface, including repairs of any damaged sidewalks and curbs. 
    Work may include the closure of individual lanes or the entire road. These replacements happen after damage has occurred on curbs and sidewalks; it is not necessarily the recreation of an entire sidewalk but rather they are state of good repair replacements.
