  notes: |
    This dataset includes the Crime Data by Neighbourhood. Counts are available for Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. Data also includes the crime rate per 100,000 population calculated using the population estimates provided by Environics Analytics.
    Following the standard definition by StatsCan, crime rate is calculated as the crime count per 100,000 population* per year. This metric facilitates the comparisons of crime between geographic areas with different size of populations. Comparing to crime count, crime rate provides a fairer comparison of the crime over time by taking into account the change in population in the region.
    Note: Fields have been included for the new 158 City of Toronto Neighbourhoods structure 
    *Population figures reflect only the resident population of a region. The temporary population such as the commuters and business patrons are not included.
